## 🧠 About Omnifood

We are a tech company focused on consumer well-being through healthy eating. Life is busy — with work, family, friends, and daily tasks — and there's often little time to cook. That can lead to poor diets and long-term health issues.

We solve this with an AI-driven approach. Users tell us their dietary preferences in the app, and our algorithm builds a fully personalized weekly meal plan.

But we go further: we partner with local restaurants and chefs who cook and deliver the meals in select cities. All this is bundled into a monthly subscription with the option to receive one or two meals per day, every day of the month.
